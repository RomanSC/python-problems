    The problem:

    You place 100 coins heads up in a row and number them by position, with the coin all the way on the left No. 1 and the one on the rightmost edge
    No. 100. Next, for every number N, from 1 to 100, you flip over every coin whose position is a multiple of N. For example, first you'll flip over
    every coin whose position is a multiple of N. For example. First you'll flip over all the coins, because every number is a multiple of 1. Then you'll
    flip over all the even-numbered coins, because theyre multiples of 2. Then you'll flip coins No. 3, 6, 9, 12 and so on.
